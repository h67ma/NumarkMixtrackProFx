## Notes
Please note that the Pro FX is my first controller and I'm very new to DJing, so I may not know how some advanced controller features are supposed to work like. I'm just trying to replicate the controller's behaviour inside VirtualDJ. Also, I don't know if it's just me, but I find the Mixxx scripting API extremely confusing, so there might be some stupid mistakes in code.
